# CoinMarketcap-NewTokenScanner

We all know that most of new tokens being added to the list of recently added in the coinmarketcap will be pump in within 30mins.
If we know the immediately after the token being added then we can take advances of it.
That's why I have created this script to keep scanning for the new added token while working on another thing.

1. Find your own api key here: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/
2. Copy the script and goto the coinmarketcap website
3. Press F12 to open your browser console. You need to google search if you are using a safari on macos
4. Paste the script to the console and hit enter.
5. Whenever it found a new added token, music will play to let you know!
6. Enjoy!!!
